## Greetings, stranger!

My name is Abdallah. I'm a nearly-graduated student majoring in Computer Engineering, mostly proficient in web programming (PHP and JavaScript, with CodeIgniter and Laravel) but also interested in automatization using Python. In my thesis, I researched the security of several of my university's websites, which had been a very lovely learning experience for me. 

Currently, I'm an intern at ICT department of [FKIP UNS](https://fkip.uns.ac.id/en) as a web developer plus IT support (since July 2021), but open to job offer, should you have any!

If necessary, you can reach me from [email](mailto:mrifqyabdallah@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrifqy-abdallah). Have a good day!
