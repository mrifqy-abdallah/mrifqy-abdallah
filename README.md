## Hi!

My name is Abdallah. I'm an end-of-year student majoring in Computer Engineering, mostly proficient in web and mobile programming but also interested in automatization and cloud computing. Currently taking lessons in [Bangkit 2021](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/) and working on my thesis (skripsi).

You can reach me from [email](mailto:mrifqyabdallah@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrifqy-abdallah). Have a good day!
